      <h2>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h2>
      <p>
        Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
        friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel,
        then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to
        Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

        Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
